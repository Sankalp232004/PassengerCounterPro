# Passenger Counter Pro

A single-page showcase for tracking passengers with flair. This project keeps the original "count and save" idea but layers in a polished UI, recruiter-friendly storytelling, and data persistence so you can demo it confidently during applications.

## Features

- Live counter with increment, decrement, quick add, and reset controls
- Editable station, transit line, and daily goal targets
- Shift insights: totals, last log time, average per entry, and entry count
- Journey log timeline with localStorage persistence
- Undo, history clearing, CSV export, keyboard shortcuts, and animated feedback
- Light/dark theme toggle for presenting in different lighting setups

## Quick start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Adjust the station/goal inputs and start logging riders.

No build tools or frameworks are required.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Log the current count |
| `+` | Increment by one |
| `-` | Decrement by one (when possible) |

## Demo tips

- Show recruiters how data persists after refresh, then export the CSV to highlight real-time reporting.
- Toggle themes to demonstrate attention to presentation environments.
- Point out the journey log insights to emphasize metrics storytelling.

## Deployment

Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Build from branch → `main`) and share the public URL in your resume or portfolio.
